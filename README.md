# Complete functional mapping of NHP vaccine-elicited antibody lineages that target the fusion peptide of HIV
### Adam S. Dingens,  Julie Overbaugh, and Jesse D. Bloom
### In collaboration with the Kwong and Mascola groups at the NIH VRC

Experiments analyzed here were performed by Adam Dingens in the [Bloom lab](http://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) and [Overbaugh lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/overbaugh/en.html) in the summer of 2018.  

Here, we use mutational antigenic profiling to comprehensively map escape from macaque vaccine-elicited antibodies lineages. 
These are:
> * `106B6`, `106E6`, and `110D12`; clonally related mAbs from from NHP **DFPH**.
> * `DF1W203` and `DF1W314` (DF1W-a.01);  clonally related mAbs from from NHP **DF1W**.
> * `OPV12` and `OPV20`;  mAbs from from NHP **OPV**. I beleive these are not clonally related?
> * `17D4` (A12V163-17D4); from NHP **A12V163**, which has very limited breadth  (~3%). 

 We use **BG505.T332N** mutant Env virus libraries. Importnantly, this is sequence matched to most of the immunogens, which were BG505 Fp and BG505 SOSIP trimer (though sometimes a different trimer boost was used). The generation and characterization of the BG505 mutant virus libraires is described in detail in [Haddox, Dingens et al. eLife 2017](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34420). 

[Dingens et al. Plos Pathogens 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007159) details mutational antigenic profiling of the template bnAb `N123-VRC34.01` and the murine vaccine-elicited antibodies `2712-vFP16.02`, and `2716-vFP20.01`.  [Dingens et al. Cell Host & Microbe 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2017.05.003) explains HIV mutational antigenic proifling in detail. 

Here, we use [dms_tools2](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/) to analyze the data.  This notebook processes the Illumina deep sequencing data, and then analyzes the selection in the context of the antibody. 

The barcoded subamplicon Illumina sequencing approach is described in detail [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/bcsubamp.html), and `differential selection` is described [here](https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/diffsel.html).


## Organization
The mutational antigenic profiling analysis is performed by the iPython notebook [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb). 

Subdirectories:

   * `./results/` iss generated by [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb). It contains the `codoncounts` and `differential selection` data and raw output for all figures.
   
   * `./results/FASTQ_files/` contains the input Illumina deep sequencing data. This file is generated by [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb), which downloads the sequencing files from the [Sequence Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

   * `./data/` contains all input data needed to run [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb)). Files are described in the iPython notebok when used. 


## Results and Conclusions
All of the results are breifly detailed in the [`analysis_notebook.ipynb`](analysis_notebook.ipynb) notebook; click on this notebook to see the results.
